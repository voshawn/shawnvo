### About My Job
Right now, our company in a phase where we all where multiple hats. For me, I
need to be a people manager, a company operator, and a software
engineer. Right now, those are in order of relative importance.

**People Manager**: Our company needs to attact and maintain the best
people. My job is to empower you do meaningful work and lead fulfulling lives
so that you're where you want to be and you're growing at the
rate you want. I hope that by creating that enviroment, you'll stay for a
long time.

**Company Operator**: I need to make sure that the company is running smoothly,
that everyone is playing nicely, and that we are moving in the right direction.
A lot of the time, this is making sure things are organized and that tasks are completed,
but many times it's making tough decisions.

**Software Engineer**: Given our stage, I am still writing a lot of code.
Writing great code and making smart technical decisions are somethings
that takes concentation and requires a lot of context. I am aware that this
trades off with being readily available. This is why I have developed a system
that I think works well.
