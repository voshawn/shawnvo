# How to Shawn

### What is this?
Hi, I'm so glad we are working together. In order to make this an awesome relationship, there are some things I thought you should know about me.
Keep in mind that this document, like myself, is a work in progress. Issues and pull requests are welcome! I will try to keep you updated as I make changes. 

### About My Job 
Here are my main responsibilities at the moment as CTO, COO, and Integrator:
1. I help shape our company's long term strategy and vision, but ultimately my job is to make sure that all teams across the organization are working together to realize this vision. 
2. Create an environment for all employees to do their most impactful work and lead their most fulfilling life. My goal is to build a system that aligns individual aspirations with our company needs and objectives.  I want to ensure that you're where you want to be and growing at the rate you want. If I do this well, I hope we can work together for a long time. And if the day comes where that alignment is no longer possible, I want you to look back on Denim and one of the best places you have ever worked. 
3. Provide context on priorities, why things are a certain way, why we do certain things, and where we want to go. I have a lot of our company's historical and "global" context, so by sharing it with you, you can make the best decisions for the company. 
4. Temporarily handle high priority and complex issues that we haven't hired or trained someone for yet. My goal is that eventually I make myself redundant. 


### Communication
In general, I am always available on Slack. Since most of my work is internal, I'll only check my emails once or twice a day so that's generally not the best place to reach me. 

Sometimes, I will dump information to you on Slack because I'm thinking about it right now, but I don't necessarily expect you to respond immediately.
If it is unrelated to something we recently talked about or if it's really early, really late, or on weekends, you should feel comfortable responding when it's most convenient.

I expect that you set your own Slack "notifications preferences" based on your working hours. If it is truly an emergency I will "notify anyway". I have done this maybe 2 times in the last year.  I believe this is the best way for us to be able to feel comfortable detaching. 

I am notoriously bad at unscheduled phone calls and text messages since my phone is generally on silent to avoid distractions.

#### Flash Tags
In a fully remote setting, it is often hard to tell how strong a person feels about a certain idea. We want to encourage people to share their thoughts freely. However, whenthe CTO makes a statement, it might be perceived to be a strong directive, when it might be just a mere suggestion. 
Below is how I try to use "flashtags" in my statements. 

- **#fyi or #idea:** I haven't spent a lot of time thinking about it. You can read it or not. Act on it or not. No response needed or expected.
- **#suggestion:** Here's something I would do if I were you. But, I'm not you -- and you own this, so your call. Just consider it and weigh it against other things you're considering. I won't be offended if you go another way. A quick reaction/response would be appreciated (so I can learn what kinds of suggestions are useful/valuable), but is not necessary.
- **#recommndation:** I've thought about this a lot. It's kept me up at night. I dug in. I think I understand the tradeoffs. You can choose not to take te recommendation, and go your own way, but please do it for good reasons.  Please dig in a bit yourself and have a well-reasoned rationale for why you don’t want to take the recommendation. Please don’t ignore or dismiss it out of hand. A response (either way) is politely requested.
_ **#Plea:** We don't like issuing edicts or directives. But...please, please, please just do this. Trust works both ways, and I need you to trust me on this. If you still feel compelled to resist, something’s not right, let's chat. Maybe even in (gasp!) person.

### Meetings
Time is our most important asset. I am a firm believer in being prepared for meetings. If you can, please do as much pre-work as you can so the meeting is more productive. In addition, I expect that you are fully engaged (no slacking) and someone is taking notes. If you feel like this meeting isn't relevant to you, you can drop off. 

### My Time Preferences 
0. **My Mornings:** Reserved mostly for my "deep work" time, preparing for meetings that day, or taking external meetings. Many of my best ideas are thoughts I have during a morning workout. 
1. **Strategy Monday:** This is where I have my "Strategy" meetings to set the pace for the week. This usually includes Exec Session and OKR Check-ins. 
2. **Deep Work Tuesday:** This is for me to work on my big "rocks" for the week. 
3. **1:1 Wednesday:** This day is for you. This is where we will have most of our 1:1s (see below). 
4. **Working Sessions Thursdays:** This time is for me to help with your team / department goals. I can provide feedback, share context, help problem solve.
5. **Staff Friday:** My ideal friday will be to sit in on the team demos, lead a productive staff meeting, and have a series of skip-level 1:1s in the afternoon. 
6. **Weekend Review:** Usually on a Saturday or Sunday, I will spend a few hours reviewing our KPIs and OKR updates to help me share context and prioritize the next week. 


In general, we have three types of meetings:
##### Working Sessions
This is where we focus on company issues. We use this time to solve some problem, share information, or make a decision. We should know what the goal of the meeting is prior to meeting. 

For these meetings, I would appreciate you sending me context beforehand and if you do so, you can expect me to be prepared and fully engaged during the meeting.

##### Personal 1:1s
This is where we focus on you. You tell me what's good or bad. Tell me how I can make your life easier. A good framework is tell me things you want **more** of, **less** of, or to **stop**. We should focus on things that are beyond the moment like your personal / career development. 

I want to avoid this being status update on your department since I should be able to get status updates through other channels. However we can certainly talk about some of the challenges and problems you are working through. 

I would also appreciate if you have any feedback to share with me during this meeting. I may share feedback with you too. 

### Feedback
We should feel safe delivering feedback to each other. There will never be any punishment associated with delivering or receiving feedback. If anything, we reward that.
I think feedback should:
- Include positive and negative
- Be delivered as real-time as possible
- Have the intention of helping the other person grow
- Address the behavior or action, not the person
- Be actionable

##### How I Give
- If it's something tactical, I will most likely tell you as I notice it. It will probably be unstructured. These will be more like *Learning Moments*, so feel free to ask questions to clarify. (ex. Hey this might be a better way to do X,Y,Z...) 
- If it's something behavioral, I will try to find examples and synthesize it a bit more. This will likely come through in our 1:1s, feedback circles, or quarterly check-ins. 
##### How I Receive
- Be direct, calm, and serious. If it is delivered jokingly, I might not take it seriously or think it's a real problem.
- I appreciate things when they are delivered in a rational, not emotional way.
- Help me understand the *why* and help me come up with a *solution*.
- If I seem defensive, it's more likely because I am trying to understand the rational, not because I'm getting upset.

### Principles / Values
In addition to the company values, here are some things that I personally value.
- **Deep Work**: I think that in order to be really innovative and deliver excellent quality work, we need have uninterrupted time. I will try to respect your deep work timeso let me know if I'm bothering you.
- **Resourcefulness**: Sometimes we need novel solutions. Sometimes we just need to look it up. For things that we can look up, always try to find resources before reinventing the wheel or asking someone else what to do.
- **Be forward looking**: It's more important to me that an issue never happens again than it is to fix it right now.
- **Be thoughtful and complete**: Have a complete understanding of how it works. Know what the second and third-order consequences are.
- **Be intentional and proactive, not reactive**: We have too much to do for any of it to be random. Intentionality is important to make sure we get the results we want.

### How I Delegate
In order for me to delegate effectively, there are three things we need to be aligned on. I will try my best to articulate these three things, but if you feel like they aren't there, please help us get there. 

1. I need to trust that you deeply understand the problem that we are trying to solve. It should be clear what the "success criteria" is. This is not "what needs to be done" but "what is the outcome or result if we do it well". 
2. I need to trust that you are willing AND able to do the job execeptionally well. If you don't feel like you have the ability to take it on, I can help make sure you have proper context and share how I might approach it. 
3. I need to trust that you have the right priority and urgency for the work that needs to be done. We need to align on what is most important at the time. This is especially important since we often have more work than time so we need to be able to prioritize effectively. 

### Known Bugs
These are things I am currently working on. If you notice any of these things, let me know.
- During stressful / meeting heavy days, I might be pretty curt. Don't read into brief replies too much. I'm probably just trying to quickly solve the problem.
- I might get anxious when things seem clear to me, but isn't clear for others. PLEASE don't let this discourage you from asking questions. Chances are I am just frustrated that I am having a hard time articulating my thoughts. 
- Sometimes when I really want to understand something, I go into "digging mode" and will ask a rapid series of questions. Don't worry, you're not under attack and it's okay to tell me if you don't know or unsure. This happens often when there is a bug in the system or if I'm trying to understand a concept or product feature. 
- I am very prone to typos, especially when I am responding from my phone or typing quickly. If a sentence doesn't make sense, there's a good chance i just typo'ed something. You should definitely ask for clarification. If there are typos in this doc, let me know! 

If you see me not living up to anything in this document please let me know.
It’s possible that I’ve changed my mind (👍). More likely I’m dropping the ball (👎).
Either way I’d like to know.
