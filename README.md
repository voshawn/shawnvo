# How to Shawn
Pull requests welcome!

### What is this?
Hi, I'm so glad we are working together. In order to make this an awesome
relationship, there are some things I thought you should know about me.

Keep in mind that this document, like myself, is a work in progress. Issues and
pull requests are welcome!

### About My Job
Our company needs to attact and maintain the best
people. My job is to empower you do meaningful work and lead a dope life
so that you're where you want to be and growing at the rate you want. 
I hope that by creating that enviroment, we can work together for a long time.

But since, we're super small, I also have to spend alot of time writing code 
and making sure everything is running smoothly.

### Communication
In general, I am always available on Slack. However, if you have a non-urgent
task for me to do, please send it over email so it doesn't get lost. I use my
mailbox as a to-do list.

Sometimes, I will dump information on Slack because I'm thinkign about it right
now, but I don't necessarily expect you to respond immediately.
If it is unrelated to something we recently talked about or on nights / weekends,
you should feel comfortable responding when it's most convenient.

I am notoriously bad at unscheduled phone calls and text messages since my phone is
generally on silent to avoid distractions.

### Meetings
I am a firm believer in being prepared for meetings. If you can, please do as
much pre-work as you can so the meeting is more productive.

Feel free to book time on my calendar between 10am and 4pm. Before 10 and after 4, I am
usually coding or engaged in deep work

In general, we have two types of meetings:
##### Working meetings
This is where we focus on the company. We use this time to solve some problem, share information, or make a
decision. We should know what the goal of the meeting is.
##### Personal 1:1s
This is where we focus on you. You tell me what's good or bad. Tell me how I
can make your life easier. A good framework is tell me things you want **more of,
less of, or to stop**. We can focus on things that are beyond the moment like
your personal / career development. Talk about anything / everything!

### Feedback
I think feedback should:
- Include positive and negative
- Be delivered as real-time as possible
- Have the intention of helping the other person grow
- Address the behavior or action, not the person
- Be actionable
We should feel safe delivering feedback to each other. There will never be any punishment for delivering feedback. 
##### How I Give
- If it's coding / engineering related, I will most likely tell you as I notice it.
It will probably be unstructured. These will be more like *Learning Moments*,
so feel free to ask questions to clarify.
- If it's a behavioral thing, I will tell you how important it is, why it's
good or bad, what I think you should do.
##### How I Receive
- Be direct, calm, and serious. If it is delivered jokingly, I might not take it
seriously or think it's a real problem.
- I appreciate things when they are delivered in a rational, not emotional way.
- Help me understand the *why* and help me come up with a *solution*.
- If I get defensive, it's more likely because I am trying to understand the rational,
not because I'm getting upset.

### Principles / Values
In addition to the company values, here are some things that I really like.
- **Deep Work**: I think that in order to be really innovative or write great
code, we need have uniterrupted time. I will try to respect your deep work time
so let me know if I'm bothering you.
- **Resourcefulness**: Sometimes we need novel solutions.
Sometimes we just need to look it up. For things that we can look up, always
try to google it before reinventing the wheel or asking around.
- **Be forward looking**: It's more important to me that the bug never happens
again than it is to fix it right now.
- **Be thoughtful and complete**: Have a complete understanding of how it works.
Know what the second and third order consequences are.
- **Be intentional and proactive, not reactive**:We have too much to do for any of it to be random.
Intentionality is important to make sure we get the results we want.

### Known Bugs
These are things I am currently working on. If you notice any of these things, let me know.
- I'm quite prone to analysis paralysis.
- I tend to shut down ideas if I think it's not possible, rather than finding ways to
make it possible.
- I get irritable when I'm hungry. If you have really bad news, tell me after
lunch.
- If you see me not living up to anything included please let me know.
It‚Äôs possible that I‚Äôve changed my mind (üëç). More likely I‚Äôm dropping the ball (üëé).
Either way I‚Äôd like to know.
