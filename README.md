# How to Shawn

### What is this?
Hi, I'm so glad we are working together. In order to make this an awesome
relationship, there are some things I thought you should know about me.

Keep in mind that this document, like myself, is a work in progress. Issues and
pull requests are welcome!

### About My Job
Here are my main responsibilities at the moment:
1. Attract and bring the best people on our team. Our company will only be as great as the people on the team. 
2. Create an environment for you to do meaningful work and have an amazing life
   so that you're where you want to be and growing at the rate you want. 
   If I do this well, I hope we can work together for a long time.
3. Provide context on priorities, why things are a certain way, why we do certain things, and where we want to go.
   I have a lot of our company's historical and "global" context, so by sharing it with you, you can make the best 
   decisions for us. 
4. Handle high priority and complex issues that we haven't hired someone for yet. My goal is that eventually
   I make myself redundant. 


### Communication
In general, I am always available on Slack. Since most of my work is internal, I'll
only check my emails once or twice a day so that's generally not the best place to reach me. 

Sometimes, I will dump information to you on Slack because I'm thinking about it right
now, but I don't necessarily expect you to respond immediately.
If it is unrelated to something we recently talked about or on nights / weekends,
you should feel comfortable responding when it's most convenient.

I am notoriously bad at unscheduled phone calls and text messages since my phone is
generally on silent to avoid distractions.

### Meetings
Time is our most important asset. I am a firm believer in being prepared for meetings. 
If you can, please do as much pre-work as you can so the meeting is more productive. 
In addition, if it is worth having a meeting for, it is probably worth taking notes so we don't forget.

Since we're small, I also have to spend alot of time with individual contributions as well.
Feel free to book time on my calendar on my "Meeting Days" which are 
Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday. The other days are my "Maker Days" which I try to
reserve for deep work, coding, or strategic planning. 

In general, we have two types of meetings:
##### Working meetings
This is where we focus on company issues. We use this time to solve some problem, share information, or make a
decision. We should know what the goal of the meeting is prior to meeting.
##### Personal 1:1s
This is where we focus on you. You tell me what's good or bad. Tell me how I
can make your life easier. A good framework is tell me things you want **more** of,
**less** of, or to **stop**. We can focus on things that are beyond the moment like
your personal / career development. Talk about anything / everything!

### Feedback
We should feel safe delivering feedback to each other. There will never be any punishment 
associated with delivering or receiving feedback. If anything, we reward that.
I think feedback should:
- Include positive and negative
- Be delivered as real-time as possible
- Have the intention of helping the other person grow
- Address the behavior or action, not the person
- Be actionable
##### How I Give
- If it's coding / engineering related, I will most likely tell you as I notice it.
It will probably be unstructured. These will be more like *Learning Moments*,
so feel free to ask questions to clarify.
- If it's a behavioral thing, I will tell you how important it is, why it's
good or bad, what I think you should do.
##### How I Receive
- Be direct, calm, and serious. If it is delivered jokingly, I might not take it
seriously or think it's a real problem.
- I appreciate things when they are delivered in a rational, not emotional way.
- Help me understand the *why* and help me come up with a *solution*.
- If I seem defensive, it's more likely because I am trying to understand the rational,
not because I'm getting upset.

### Principles / Values
In addition to the company values, here are some things that I really like.
- **Deep Work**: I think that in order to be really innovative or write great
code, we need have uninterrupted time. I will try to respect your deep work time
so let me know if I'm bothering you.
- **Resourcefulness**: Sometimes we need novel solutions.
Sometimes we just need to look it up. For things that we can look up, always
try to google it before reinventing the wheel or asking around.
- **Be forward looking**: It's more important to me that the bug never happens
again than it is to fix it right now.
- **Be thoughtful and complete**: Have a complete understanding of how it works.
Know what the second and third-order consequences are.
- **Be intentional and proactive, not reactive**: We have too much to do for any of it to be random.
Intentionality is important to make sure we get the results we want.

### Known Bugs
These are things I am currently working on. If you notice any of these things, let me know.
- During stressful / meeting heavy days, I might be pretty curt. Don't read into brief replies too much.
  Chances are, I'm just trying to quickly solve the problem.
- I can come off as annoyed when things that seem clear to me isn't clear for others. 
- Sometimes when I really want to understand something, I go into "digging mode" and will ask a rapid series of questions. 
  Don't worry, you're not under attack and it's okay to tell me if you don't know or unsure. This happens often 
  when there is a bug in the system or if I'm trying to understand a concept or product feature. 
- I can get a bit irritable when I'm tired or hungry. 

If you see me not living up to anything included please let me know.
It‚Äôs possible that I‚Äôve changed my mind (üëç). More likely I‚Äôm dropping the ball (üëé).
Either way I‚Äôd like to know.
